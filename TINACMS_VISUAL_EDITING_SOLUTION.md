# TinaCMS Visual Editing Solution

## The Core Issue

You're experiencing a known TinaCMS bug where visual editing doesn't open consistently. Sometimes clicking a page shows visual editing, other times it shows the form editor. This is documented in [GitHub issue #5255](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/issues/5255).

## Current Status of Your Setup

✅ **Everything is configured correctly:**
- Site URL is set properly in TinaCloud
- Environment variables are correct in Vercel
- Your code implementation (useTina, ui.router) is correct
- TinaCloud is connected and working

❌ **The problem:**
- TinaCMS isn't consistently detecting when to show visual editing
- There's no "Preview" button or toggle to manually switch modes
- This is a TinaCMS platform issue, not a configuration issue

## Immediate Workarounds

### 1. Force Visual Editing via URL Parameters

Try accessing your pages with these URL patterns:

```
https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/components/action?tina-admin=true
https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/components/action?edit=true
```

### 2. Direct Visual Editor Access

Try these direct URLs in TinaCloud:

```
https://app.tina.io/projects/d34d54f8-0563-4bee-8bd1-ef3a6d3498d4/visual/page/action
https://app.tina.io/cody-marshalls-organization/eleven-design-system/visual/documentation-pages/action
```

### 3. Check for Hidden UI Elements

In the form editor, look for:
- Any small icons in the top bar
- Right-click to see if there's a context menu
- Keyboard shortcuts (try Cmd/Ctrl + P)

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Add a Manual Preview Button

Since TinaCMS doesn't consistently show visual editing, you could add a custom preview button to your pages:

```tsx
// In your component pages
const isEditMode = typeof window !== 'undefined' && 
  (window.location.search.includes('tina-admin') || 
   window.location.hostname.includes('app.tina.io'));

if (isEditMode) {
  return (
    <div>
      <a 
        href={`${window.location.pathname}?visual=true`} 
        target="_blank"
        style={{
          position: 'fixed',
          top: 10,
          right: 10,
          zIndex: 9999,
          background: 'blue',
          color: 'white',
          padding: '10px',
        }}
      >
        Open Visual Editor
      </a>
      {/* Your content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Contact TinaCloud Support

Since this is a known issue, contact support with:
- Reference GitHub issue #5255
- Your Client ID: d34d54f8-0563-4bee-8bd1-ef3a6d3498d4
- Request: "Visual editing not opening consistently, only showing form editor"

### 3. Monitor TinaCMS Updates

Follow the GitHub issue for updates. The TinaCMS team is aware of this problem.

## Alternative Workflow

While visual editing is inconsistent, you can still effectively use TinaCMS:

1. **Use the Form Editor** (what you're seeing now):
   - Edit content in the form
   - Click "Save"
   - Open your site in a new tab to preview changes

2. **Use Local Development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Access http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Visual editing might work more consistently locally

## What Visual Editing SHOULD Look Like

When working properly, clicking a page in TinaCloud should:
1. Open your site in an iframe
2. Show the TinaCMS sidebar on the right
3. Allow click-to-edit on content
4. Show real-time updates as you type

## Technical Investigation

To help debug, try:

1. **Check Browser Console**: When on the form editor page, open DevTools and run:
   ```javascript
   // Check if visual editing data is available
   console.log(window.__TINA__)
   console.log(window.location)
   ```

2. **Verify Collection Settings**: In your tina/config.ts, ensure:
   ```ts
   ui: {
     router: ({ document }) => {
       // This should return the correct path
       const slug = document._sys.filename.replace(/\.mdx?$/, '');
       return `/components/${slug}`;
     },
   }
   ```

## Summary

You've done everything correctly. This is a known TinaCMS issue where visual editing doesn't consistently open. The form editor you're seeing is TinaCMS's fallback when visual editing fails to initialize. Until TinaCMS fixes this issue, use the workarounds above or stick with the form editor for content management.
