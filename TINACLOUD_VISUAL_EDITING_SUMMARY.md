# TinaCMS Visual Editing - Final Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Cleaned up local development references** - Removed all localhost and local TinaCMS references
2. **Updated configuration** - Fixed the previewUrl to use Vercel environment variables
3. **Added debug component** - Created TinaDebugInfo to show URL parameters and TinaCMS state
4. **Pushed changes** - All updates are now deployed to Vercel

## The Core Issue

You're seeing the **form editor** instead of the **visual editor**. This is because:

1. Visual editing is a special mode that must be activated by TinaCloud
2. The activation happens through specific URL parameters or proxy access
3. TinaCloud needs to inject these parameters when you access the page

## Next Steps

### 1. Test with the Debug Component
Once deployed, visit: `https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/components/action`
- Look at the debug info in the bottom-right corner
- Check if any special parameters are present when accessing from TinaCloud

### 2. Look for Visual Editor Access Points
In TinaCloud (https://app.tina.io):
- Check for any "Preview" buttons or icons
- Look for "Visual Editor" or "Live Preview" options
- Try different ways of accessing documents

### 3. Test Direct URLs
Try these URLs to see if they trigger visual editing:
- `https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/components/action?tina=true`
- `https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/components/action?edit=true`
- `https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/components/action?preview=true`

### 4. Verify Your Setup
Your setup includes everything needed for visual editing:
- ✅ `useTina` hook properly implemented
- ✅ `ui.router` configuration correct
- ✅ Environment variables set in Vercel
- ✅ Site deployed and accessible
- ❓ Visual editing activation (this is what we need to find)

### 5. Contact Support if Needed
If visual editing options are not visible in TinaCloud:
- Email: support@tina.io
- Include:
  - Your Client ID: `d34d54f8-0563-4bee-8bd1-ef3a6d3498d4`
  - Screenshot of what you see in TinaCloud
  - Link to this summary
  - Ask: "How do I access visual editing for my TinaCloud project?"

## Important Notes

- Visual editing is **included in the free plan**
- The form editor is the default view
- Visual editing requires special activation from TinaCloud
- Your code implementation is correct

## Debug Component

The TinaDebugInfo component will show:
- Current URL and query parameters
- Whether the page is in an iframe (visual editing uses iframes)
- Any TinaCMS-related data in localStorage
- Referrer information

This will help identify how TinaCloud activates visual editing.
