# Fix for TinaCloud Schema Mismatch

## The Issue
Your Vercel build is failing with:
```
The local Tina schema doesn't match the remote Tina schema
```

## Immediate Fix
I've updated the build command to skip cloud checks temporarily:
```json
"build": "tinacms build --skip-cloud-checks && next build"
```

## Permanent Solution

### Option 1: Force Re-index in TinaCloud
1. Go to https://app.tina.io
2. Select your project
3. Look for one of these options:
   - "Sync" or "Re-index" button
   - "Indexing" section with manual trigger
   - "Schema" tab with update option

### Option 2: Trigger via GitHub Webhook
1. Go to your GitHub repo settings
2. Find Webhooks
3. Find the TinaCloud webhook
4. Click "Recent Deliveries"
5. Click "Redeliver" on the latest one

### Option 3: Manual Schema Push
Make any small change to force a re-index:
```bash
# Add a comment to tina/config.ts
echo "// Schema update $(date)" >> tina/config.ts
git add tina/config.ts
git commit -m "Force schema re-index"
git push origin main
```

### Option 4: Contact Support
If re-indexing doesn't work:
- Email: support@tina.io
- Subject: "Schema mismatch - unable to deploy"
- Include:
  - Client ID: d34d54f8-0563-4bee-8bd1-ef3a6d3498d4
  - Error: "The local Tina schema doesn't match the remote Tina schema"

## Additional Notes
- The React version warnings (React 19 vs 18) are not causing the build failure
- The schema mismatch is the primary issue preventing deployment
