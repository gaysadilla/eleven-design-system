# Fix TinaCloud Visual Editing - Step by Step

## Issue 1: Schema Mismatch (Blocking Deployment)

The deployment is failing because TinaCloud's schema is out of sync. Here's how to fix it:

### Option A: Force Schema Update (Quickest)
1. Go to https://app.tina.io
2. Select your project
3. Go to Configuration tab
4. Look for "Schema" or "Sync Schema" option
5. Click "Sync" or "Update Schema"

### Option B: Manual Index Update
1. Make a small change to any content file
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Force schema re-index"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Wait for TinaCloud to re-index (usually 1-2 minutes)

## Issue 2: Enable Visual Editing Mode

Visual editing requires specific configuration in TinaCloud:

1. **In TinaCloud Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Look for "Visual Editing" or "Preview Mode" settings
   - Ensure it's enabled
   - Save changes

2. **Update Site URL** (Already done âœ“):
   - Site URL is correctly set to: https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app

3. **Access Visual Editing**:
   - After enabling visual editing, you should see:
     - An "Open in Visual Editor" button
     - Or a toggle between "Form" and "Visual" modes
     - Or access through a specific URL pattern

## Issue 3: Temporary Workaround for Visual Editing

While we fix the configuration, try accessing visual editing directly:

1. Go to: https://app.tina.io/projects/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/editor
2. Or try: https://app.tina.io/[YOUR_ORGANIZATION]/[YOUR_PROJECT]/editor

## Issue 4: React Version Compatibility

The React 19 warnings are not blocking, but if needed, you can downgrade:

```json
// package.json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
  // ... rest of dependencies
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check TinaCloud Project Type**:
   - Some TinaCloud plans don't include visual editing
   - Verify your plan supports visual editing features

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open DevTools when in TinaCloud admin
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

3. **Try Different Access Methods**:
   - Direct URL: https://app.tina.io
   - Through your site: https://eleven-design-system.vercel.app/admin
   - Check for any redirects or authentication issues

## If Visual Editing Still Doesn't Work

1. **Contact TinaCloud Support**:
   - Mention you're trying to enable visual editing
   - Provide your Client ID: d34d54f8-0563-4bee-8bd1-ef3a6d3498d4
   - Ask if visual editing is enabled for your account

2. **Check Documentation**:
   - https://tina.io/docs/contextual-editing/overview
   - Ensure all requirements are met

3. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Use the form-based editor (what you're seeing now)
   - Visual editing might require additional setup or plan upgrade
