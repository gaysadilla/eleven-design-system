# Fix for Component Page 500 Error

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Params Handling
Changed from Next.js 15's async params pattern:
```typescript
// Before
params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
const { slug } = await params;

// After
params: { slug: string }
const resolvedParams = await Promise.resolve(params);
const slug = resolvedParams.slug;
```

This ensures compatibility with both sync and async params.

### 2. Added Dynamic Rendering
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to force server-side rendering and avoid build-time errors with TinaCMS data fetching.

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try/catch blocks around the entire component
- Added console.error logging for debugging
- Added a user-friendly error page when exceptions occur

### 4. Improved Debugging
Added console.log statements to track:
- Which slug is being requested
- Which file variations are being tried
- Any errors during data fetching

## Testing the Fix

## If Still Getting 500 Error

Check the Vercel Function logs:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Look for `/components/[slug]` function
5. Check recent invocations for error details

The logs will now show more detailed error information thanks to the added console statements.
